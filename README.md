<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
In this project, A k-layers neural networks is designed with the implemention of He Initialisation, [Cyclical Learning Rates](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01186.pdf), [Batch Normalisation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03167.pdf). The objective is to use these neural network models to classfy images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

### Assignment01
